    solution : 
        ExoPlayer 2.9.0 Java 1.8 requirement
        ExoPlayer 2.9.0 uses some Java 1.8 features, so you may need to enable support for Java 1.8 in your app/build.gradle file. If you get an error, compiling with ExoPlayer like: Default interface methods are only supported starting with Android N (--min-api 24)

        Add the following to your app/build.gradle file:

        android {
            ... // Various other settings go here
            compileOptions {
                targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
            }
        }
